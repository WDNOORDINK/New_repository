# In this library I share a dataset that I obtained via data.world.
# This is a dataset containing a clear overview of all journalists who have died as a result of violence since 1992.
# The dataset comes from https://data.world/journalism/journalist-deaths#
# This dataset contains different variables: names of died journalists / country / nationality / organisation / source of fire / type of death.
